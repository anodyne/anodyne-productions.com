# Privacy Policy

## General Information

We do not share or sell your information to other organizations for commercial purposes. We hate when companies do that to us, so we're not going to do it to you. The only exceptions to this rule are:

- It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of [Terms of Use](), or as otherwise required by law.
- We transfer information about you if Anodyne Productions is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Anodyne will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
