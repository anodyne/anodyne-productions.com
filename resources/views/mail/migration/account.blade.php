# Greetings from Anodyne!

It's been a busy 18 months for Anodyne that culminated last week in the release of a massive amount of work that we've been doing. On top of releasing Nova 2.7 at the end of 2022, we've also been working on an all-new visual identity for both Anodyne and Nova (some of which you've likely seen already), a brand-new website and backend management system, completely re-written documentation for Nova, and the Nova Add-on Exchange to replace AnodyneXtras. We're thrilled for all of this to be live.

As a result of this work, the Anodyne account associated with this email address has been migrated to the new system. If you've already signed in to the new system, then you're good to go. If you haven't signed in yet, you'll need to reset your password from the sign in page in order to use the new system.
