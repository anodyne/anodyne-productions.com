    <x-slot name="title">A New Look for Anodyne</x-slot>

    <p>As 2020 came to a close, an idea started to percolate: if we were going to re-brand Anodyne, what might that look like?</p>

    <p>What started out as a handful of sketches in the fall of 2020 turned into a full-blown creative endeavor with multiple designers. Over the course of 3 intense weeks, 7 designers from around the world submitted their design concepts for what Anodyne's identity should be and tried to answer the question: what <em>is</em> Anodyne.</p>

    <p>The community of <a href="https://patreon.com/anodyneproductions" target="_blank">Patreon sponsors</a> endured being peppered with questions and design concepts for days on end, offering their thoughts and opinions on everything that came in from the designers.</p>

    <h2>New Logo</h2>

    <p>Seven years ago when we launched the previous version of our site Anodyne didn't actually have a proper logo. Out of necessity (Twitter, Facebook, Discord, etc.) we threw one together quickly and it's stuck around since. For the better part of a year we've toyed around with the idea of a proper logo, but it's never gone beyond some sketches on scrap paper. As we were wrapping up 2020 though the time to do this work felt right.</p>

    <p>The challenge with coming with a brand-new logo starts with defining what the thing you're trying to represent actually is. For something like Nova that's pretty straightforward; for Anodyne that was a lot more difficult. Some companies have names that lend themselves to specific imagery. Think about a company like Apple. An apple is a thing, so you have a starting point for a visual metaphor that you can work from. Anodyne isn't so lucky to have a clear-cut visual metaphor built-in to its name.</p>

    <p>We put together a very open-ended brief for the designers to provide some initial direction, but we wanted to provide them with a lot of space to play in. After defining what the company did and some basic background information, we waiting for the designs to come rolling in.</p>

    <p>For over a year now we've toyed around with the idea of a new logo, but it's never gone beyond some sketches on paper. The time to do this work felt right this time and we jumped in with both feet.</p>

    <p>It was an incredibly scary prospect as the concepts started coming in. For so many years we've used the same simple logo. It </p>

        The time has felt right for a while now given A) how long we had been using the existing logo The first piece of that puzzle was coming up with a more distinct logo than what we've been using. When the current version of the website launched in 2014, there wasn't actually a logo for Anodyne. Out of necessity, we threw one together quickly and it's stuck since then.</p>
    <p>Over the course of many weeks, we worked with several designer to craft an identity for Anodyne.</p>

    <h2>New Branding</h2>

    <p>As you browse the internet, you'll find a lot of sites using blue as their primary color. We've loved the bright shade of blue we've used for so many years, but we felt it was time for a change. One of the things we told all of the designers we worked with was that we had a color we'd been using for many years, but they weren't tied to that color and should feel free to explore other color options. We weren't disappointed by the responses!</p>

    <p>The primary color we chose, radiant yellow, embodies the bright and energetic creativity so much of our community pours into their games everyday.</p>
