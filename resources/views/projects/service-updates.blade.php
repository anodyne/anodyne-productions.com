        <p>As 2020 came to a close, an idea started to percolate: if we were going to re-brand Anodyne, what might that look like?</p>

        <hr>

        <p>What started out as a handful of sketches in the fall of 2020 turned into a full-blown creative endeavor with multiple designers. Over the course of 3 intense weeks, 7 designers from around the world submitted their design concepts for what Anodyne's identity should be and tried to answer the question: what <em>is</em> Anodyne.</p>

        <p>The community of <a href="https://patreon.com/anodyneproductions" target="_blank">Patreon sponsors</a> endured being peppered with questions and design concepts for days on end, offering their thoughts and opinions on everything that came in from the designers.</p>

        <h2>New Logo</h2>

        <p>At the end of 2020, we decided to start exploring the idea of completely re-branding Anodyne. The time felt right. The given A) how long we had been using The first piece of that puzzle was coming up with a more distinct logo than what we've been using. When the current version of the website launched in 2014, there wasn't actually a logo for Anodyne. Out of necessity, we threw one together quickly and it's stuck since then.</p>
        <p>Over the course of many weeks, we worked with several designer to craft an identity for Anodyne.</p>

        <h2>New Branding</h2>

        <p>As you browse the internet, you'll find a lot of sites using blue as their primary color. We've loved the bright shade of blue we've used for so many years, but we felt it was time for a change. One of the things we told all of the designers we worked with was that we had a color we'd been using for many years, but they weren't tied to that color and should feel free to explore other color options. We weren't disappointed by the responses!</p>

        <p>The primary color we chose, radiant yellow, embodies the bright and energetic creativity so much of our community pours into their games everyday.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>New Website</h2>

        <p>The final piece of the puzzle was a brand-new website.</p>

        <p>For this iteration of the Anodyne home (it's 7th for those keeping count), we opted for a much simpler approach. Since the vast majority of visitors are either looking to learn about Nova or download it, we've put Nova front and center.</p>

        <p>In December we announced that all support would be handled through our <a href="https://discord.gg/7WmKUks" target="_blank" class="underline text-amber-500 hover:text-orange-500 transition-colors ease-in-out duration-200">Discord server</a>. We've had a Discord server for quite a while now, but hadn't actively advertised it until December.</p>

        <p>The truth is that over the years the forums have seen less and less traffic. On top of that, our installation of phpBB is old and would require significant time to get updated to the latest version. With most RPG organizations embracing Discord in the last year, we felt it was only natural to do the same and use it as the primary means of getting help with Nova.</p>

        <p>We've disabled user registrations on the forums, but will be leaving the actual content active for a few more months in the event people want to search the forums for anything. In the first 90 days of 2021, we'll be removing the site entirely.</p>

        <p><x-badge color="green">Completed</x-badge></p>

        <p>The Help Center has been a great source of information for the community for many years, but it's fallen behind with updates and isn't as useful as it could be. The vision for the Help Center was always a place where the community could contribute to documenting how to get the most out of Nova, but bugs have crept into the system and that isn't possible with the way the system is configured.</p>

        <p>Taking a page out of the playbook of popular open source packages, the long-term solution for Nova's documentation will be through the use of a separate GitHub repository. This will provide a straightforward way to contribute back to the documentation through pull requests. (We'll be providing complete documentation on how that process will work from start to finish in the future.)</p>

        <p><x-badge color="blue">In Progress</x-badge></p>

        <p>The Anodyne staff undertook the gargantuan task of re-writing the Nova documentation from scratch. We felt it was important to start over to ensure that everything was properly and meticulously documented. We've completed our first pass at this and will continue to improve and expand the documentation based on community feedback over the coming weeks and months.</p>

        <p>The Anodyne staff is currently working on a complete re-write of the Nova 2 documentation to ensure everything is properly documented. We're also heavily focused on writing the documentation in a way that makes it easy for a beginner to get what they need, but also provides advanced topics for people who are themeing and/or modifying Nova. Once that re-write is complete, we'll be folding the documentation directly into the main Anodyne site and shutting down the Help Center in the first half of 2021.</p>

        <p><x-badge color="blue">In Progress</x-badge></p>

        <p>For years AnodyneXtras has been a one-stop shop for the community to find themes and extensions for Nova. The ease of access for the community has been a great way to find resources to help users get the most out of Nova. For developers, having an avenue of distributing their work is invaluable and eliminates the need to build a site to host their work. We intend to continue this for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <p>As we went through the services Anodyne offers, the common theme was that things weren't working as intended and AnodyneXtras was no exception. It's important to us that we provide a great experience for the community when it comes to all our services, but especially AnodyneXtras. Given its current state and the work involved with updating it, we felt the right course of action was to completely re-write the software. Like the documentation updates, we'll be rolling this new software directly into the new Anodyne site. This allows us to create a more seamless experience for all of our users.</p>

        <p>Later this year, we'll be launching the <strong>Nova Exchange</strong> as a replacement for AnodyneXtras.</p>
