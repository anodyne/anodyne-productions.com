    <x-slot name="title">Changing How You Get Help</x-slot>

    <p>In December of 2020, we announced we would be making significant changes to the way we handle support for Nova going forward. That started immediately with shutting down new user registrations and wrapped up recently with the complete removal of the forums from the server.</p>

    <p>For many years, we used the forums as a way for people to interact with us. Over the years though, the forums fell into disrepair and traffic to the forums became almost non-existent. There was more spam on the forums than actual posts.</p>

    <p>As more and more RPG organizations adopt Discord, we felt the time was right for us to shift our entire support strategy away from the forums and over to our <a href="https://discord.gg/7WmKUks" target="_blank">Discord server</a>. In the months since we made this change, we've seen a sigfificant rise in the number of people in our Discord server. If you haven't joined yet, be sure to join today!</p>
