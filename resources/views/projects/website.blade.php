    <p>As 2020 came to a close, an idea started to percolate: if we were going to re-brand Anodyne, what might that look like?</p>

    <p>What started out as a handful of sketches in the fall of 2020 turned into a full-blown creative endeavor with multiple designers. Over the course of 3 intense weeks, 7 designers from around the world submitted their design concepts for what Anodyne's identity should be and tried to answer the question: what <em>is</em> Anodyne.</p>

    <p>The community of <a href="https://patreon.com/anodyneproductions" target="_blank">Patreon sponsors</a> endured being peppered with questions and design concepts for days on end, offering their thoughts and opinions on everything that came in from the designers.</p>

    <h2>New Logo</h2>

    <p>At the end of 2020, we decided to start exploring the idea of completely re-branding Anodyne. The time felt right. The given A) how long we had been using The first piece of that puzzle was coming up with a more distinct logo than what we've been using. When the current version of the website launched in 2014, there wasn't actually a logo for Anodyne. Out of necessity, we threw one together quickly and it's stuck since then.</p>
    <p>Over the course of many weeks, we worked with several designer to craft an identity for Anodyne.</p>

    <h2>New Branding</h2>

    <p>As you browse the internet, you'll find a lot of sites using blue as their primary color. We've loved the bright shade of blue we've used for so many years, but we felt it was time for a change. One of the things we told all of the designers we worked with was that we had a color we'd been using for many years, but they weren't tied to that color and should feel free to explore other color options. We weren't disappointed by the responses!</p>

    <p>The primary color we chose, radiant yellow, embodies the bright and energetic creativity so much of our community pours into their games everyday.</p>

    <h2>New Website</h2>

    <p>The final piece of the puzzle was a brand-new website.</p>

    <p>For this iteration of the Anodyne home (it's 7th for those keeping count), we opted for a much simpler approach. Since the vast majority of visitors are either looking to learn about Nova or download it, we've put Nova front and center.</p>
